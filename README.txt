The following folders contain some Java programs I have written outside of school.

DrawFFT.java       - Draw a waveform with Click & Drag, and transform it into the
                      frequency domain in real time, using the Fast Fourier
                      Transform algorithm.  Compute the inverse on the frequency
                      data and transform back into the time domain.

Mapper.java        - Map a function f(x) on the cartesian plane, shade in the area 
                      under the curve for a user-defined interval, approximate the 
                      integral using Composite Simpson's Rule
TopoMapper.java    - Topographically map a function of two variables f(x,y) in the 
                      first quadrant of the cartesian plane, arrow keys adjust the
                      domain

Each project contains a test run image (.PNG), showing the program in action
