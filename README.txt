The following folders contain some Java programs I have written outside of school.

Mapper.java        - Map a function f(x) on the cartesian plane, shade in the area 
                      under the curve for a user-defined interval, approximate the 
                      integral using Composite Simpson's Rule
TopoMapper.java    - Topographically map a function of two variables f(x,y) in the 
                      first quadrant of the cartesian plane, arrow keys adjust the
                      domain

Each project contains a test run image (.PNG), showing the program in action

Thank you for your interest,
